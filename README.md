# Pandas Data Analysis Practice

## Overview

This repository contains hands-on practice work demonstrating core data manipulation and analysis workflows using **Python Pandas**.
It showcases foundational skills in data understanding, cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and dataset integration.

The objective of this repository is to build practical fluency in data wrangling techniques that are commonly used in **data engineering and analytics pipelines**.
